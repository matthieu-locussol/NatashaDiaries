A new static site generator baby is born. It's highly inspired by Gatsby.js (React based) but built on top of Vue.js. We have been working on it for a year and will have a beta ready soon. You can expect this baby to grow up fast!

We think **Gridsome** is a missing piece to the Vue.js ecosystem. What Gatsby.js does for React.js is a game changer in how we build websites.  React.js is excellent, but we think Vue.js is more approachable for most web designers and devs getting started with JAMstack. Gridsome is the Vue.js alternative to Gatsby.

With **Gridsome** you get a **universal GraphQL layer** for all your connected data sources. It's like a single source of truth for your website data ready to be used in any page or components. Connect to any CMS or APIs like Google Spreadsheet, Airtable, Instagram Feed, local markdown files, etc. 

#### Whats next

In the next couple of months we're going to continue to improve the docs, create tutorials, add more source & transformer plugins and fix bugs. 

#### Contribute to Gridsome

We're currently just two brothers working on this, so any contribution is very welcome. We're passionate about building a faster web and make website building fun again.

You can also support us by giving [a GitHub star â˜…](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/stargazers) and spread the word :)
